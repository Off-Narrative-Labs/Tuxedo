//! Allow block authors to include a timestamp via an inherent transaction
//!
//! This strives to be roughly analogous to FRAME's pallet timestamp and uses the same client-side inherent data provider logic.
//!
//! In this first iteration, block authors set timestamp once per block by adding a new utxo. The timestamps are never cleaned up. There are no incentives.
//! In the future, it may make sense to have them consume the previous timestamp or a timestamp from n blocks ago, or just provide incentives for users to clean up old ones.
//!
//! Some things that are still a little unclear. How do we make sure that this function is only called via inherent? Maybe forbid it in the pool.
//! If forbidding them in the pool is the answer, then we need to  consider a way to make it easy / nice for piece developers to declare that their transactions are inherents.
//! One way to make it work for users would be to adapt the macro so that you can add an `#[inherent]` to some call variants, then the macro creates a function called is_inherent that checks if it is an inherent or not.
