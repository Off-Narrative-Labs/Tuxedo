//! Allow block authors to include a timestamp via an inherent transaction.
//!
//! This is roughly analogous to FRAME's pallet timestamp. It relies on the same client-side inherent data provider,
//! as well as Tuxedo's own previous block inehrent data provider.
//!
//! In each block ,the block author must include a single `SetTimestamp` transaction.
//! 1. Comsumes the existing best timestamp UTXO (which was created in the previous block).
//! 2. Creates a new best timestamp UTXO (which will be cleaned up in the next block).
//! 3. Creates a new noted timestamp UTXO which will stick around for a minimum amount of time
//!    and, perhaps, eventually be cleaned up by a volunteer.
//!
//! This piece currently features two prominent hacks which will need to be cleaned up in due course.
//! 1. It abuses the UpForGrabs verifier. This should be replaced with an Unspendable verifier and an eviction workflow.
//! 2. In block #1 it allows creating a new best timestamp without comsuming a previous one.
//!    This should be removed once we are able to include a timestamp in the genesis block.
