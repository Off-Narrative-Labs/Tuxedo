//! This is a small pallet that handles runtime upgrades in chains that want
//! to support them.
//!
//! Right now this method is entirely unprotected (except by the redeemer) which
//! may not be realistic enough for public production chains. It should be composed
//! with some governance mechanism when one is available.
//!
//! It is not possible to adhere perfectly to the UTXO model here, because the
//! wasm code must be stored in the well-known `:code` key. We stick as closely
//! as possible to the UTXO model by having a UTXO that holds a hash of the current
//! wasm code. Then we pass the full wasm code as part of the verifier and write
//! it to the well-known key as a side effect.
