//! This file represents a simple example Tuxedo piece that tracks amoeba populations.
//! Amoeba's can be affected in three ways throughout their lifecycle.
//! 1. A new amoeba can be created by a creator. This is analogous to divine
//!    creation of a new species, and is currently not feature-gated, which
//!    is not very realistic. Ideally there would be a simple genesis config.
//! 2. An existing amoeba can die. When an amoeba dies, the utxo that represents it
//!    is consumed, and nothing new is created.
//! 3. An existing amoeba can undergo mitosis. Mitosis is a process that consumes the
//!    mother amoeba and creates, in its place two new daughter amoebas.
