## Architecture

Tuxedo is a framework for developing Substrate runtimes with the UTXO model.

In the standard UTXO model each transaction provides some inputs that represent pieces of current state to be consumed, and provides some outputs which are new pieces of state to be added to the UTXO set. The chain logic then checks that the input and output sets satisfy some constraints. For example, the input coins must have value greater or equal to the output coins. Tuxedo generalizes this model slightly in two ways. First, by adding a notion of peeks, which are pieces of state to be read only, and not modified or consumed. This reduces the frequency with with transactions race for particular UTXOs. Second, by abstracting the notion of checking a transactions so that runtime developers can plug in their own custom "Tuxedo Pieces" or use some from a standard library. Rather than being constrained to build only a cryptocurrency, developers can build _proof of stake_, _governance_, _NFT games_ or anything else they choose.

Tuxedo makes the process of developing UTXO-based runtimes faster and safer by freeing developers from having to re-implement all of the common and error-prone UTXO logic in each chain. It also makes the process more standard by providing developers with simple interfaces for their Tuxedo Pieces. When developing a Tuxedo piece, a developer will complete some or all of these following tasks.

### Declaring Data Types

If the Tuxedo piece has any custom data types, they must be declared by implementing the [`UtxoData` trait](https://off-narrative-labs.github.io/Tuxedo/tuxedo_core/dynamic_typing/trait.UtxoData.html). For example, a crytpocurrency may have a data type called `Coin` or a voting solution may have data types called `Poll` and `Vote`. The developer only has to declare the data type; there is no notion of a "storage item" because there is no global state in the UTXO model. All state is local to individual UTXOs.

### Defining Transaction Constraints

All Tuxedo pieces will define one or more sets of constraints that a transaction must satisfy to be valid. This is done through a [`ConstraintChecker` trait](https://off-narrative-labs.github.io/Tuxedo/tuxedo_core/constraint_checker/trait.ConstraintChecker.html). Unlike the accounts model, the Tuxedo piece is not responsible for calculating the final state after the transaction. Rather, the final state is passed in as the transaction's output set. The piece only checks that the appropriate constraints are met. For example, it may check that in an on-chain chess game, the input piece really is allowed to move to the location specified in the output. In a more classic example, it will check that the tokens being spent are of greater or equal value to the tokens being created.

### Declaring Verification Logic

Each individual UTXO in the UTXO set is protected by a piece of associated logic that determines when it may be spent. This logic is defined in the [`Verifier` Trait](https://off-narrative-labs.github.io/Tuxedo/tuxedo_core/verifier/trait.Verifier.html). The most classic example is that the UTXO is owned by a particular public key and the transaction must be signed by that key in order to unlock the input. Other examples also exist, such as, the UTXO may be claimable by anyone, or by nobody at all, or it may require a valid proof or work to be consumed.

Tuxedo core provides the most common verification logic already, so it is uncommon that individual pieces need to add custom verification logic, but the possibility exists none-the-less.

### Note on Unit Testing

A Tuxedo piece should be thoroughly unit tests, like any quality piece of software. It is worth noting that, because all state is local to UTXOs and there are no global storage items, the unit tests can be much simpler than a typical account-based Substrate runtime. It is not even necessary to uses storage externalities when testing Tuxedo pieces because Tuxedo core handles all of the storage access itself. The piece developers only have to focus on the actual constraint-checking logic.

## Repository Contents

This mono-repo contains the core Tuxedo code as well as an example node built with Tuxedo and a proof-of-concept wallet to transfer tokens.

### Tuxedo Core

The reusable core of the Tuxedo framework lives in the `tuxedo-core` directory. This crate will be used by every runtime built with Tuxedo. The best way to explore this crate is by browsing its [code](./tuxedo-core/) or its [hosted rustdocs](https://off-narrative-labs.github.io/Tuxedo/tuxedo_core/index.html). It contains:

- The core data types for the UTXO model such as `Input`, `Output`, `OutputRef`, `Transaction`, and others.
- A standard interface for developers to access the UTXO set.
- Common transaction validation logic that all UTXO transactions need to conduct.
- A dynamic typing system to allow developers to store bespoke data types in the UTXO set in a type-safe manner,
- Public interfaces for developers to implement while writing their own Tuxedo pieces.

### Template Runtime

There is an example runtime built with Tuxedo in the `tuxedo-template-runtime` directory. This runtime is analogous to the popular [Substrate node template runtime](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/tree/main/runtime), but it uses Tuxedo and the UTXO model rather than the accounts model. Developers wanting to build with Tuxedo should inspect this example runtime to get familiar with how to use Tuxedo, and then fork it to begin developing their own runtime.

The best way to explore this runtime is by browsing its [code](./tuxedo-template-runtime/) or its [hosted rustdocs](https://off-narrative-labs.github.io/Tuxedo/tuxedo_template_runtime/index.html)

### Template Node

There is an example node built with the Tuxedo template runtime. Because Tuxedo is primarily a runtime development framework, there is not much interesting or unique to Tuxedo to see in this crate. It is mostly a copy from the popular [Substrate node template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/tree/main/node).

### Wallet

The repo contains a CLI cryptocurrency wallet that works with the template node in the `wallet` directory.
The wallet allows users to see their token balances and send transactions.
It also allows advanced interactions like seeing the exact UTXOs you own, choosing specific UTXOs for a transaction, and constructing transactions with UTXOs from diverse owners.
From a developer perspective, this wallet can serve as a starting point for building your own CLI dApp UI.

## Funding and Roadmap

Special thanks to the [Web 3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/) for their support of Tuxedo through their grants program.

As part of this grant we will deliver three milestones. More details are available in the [Tuxedo grant application](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/tuxedo.md).

- ‚úÖ Core Tuxedo Functionality (complete)
- ‚úÖ Template wallet (complete)
- üèóÔ∏è Full Documentation and Tutorial (in progress)

After the grant work is complete we intend to continue developing Tuxedo. The future is less clear, but our current ideas include:

- üîÆ Cumulus and Parachain support including cross-chain UTXOs
- üîÆ Zero-knowledge runtimes a-la [zero-cash](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2014/papers/Zerocash_c_DecentralizedAnonymousPaymentsfromBitcoin.pdf) and [zexe](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9152634&ref=)
- üîÆ UTXO-native Smart Contracts based on the pi-calculus

## Building and Running Locally

First you'll need to have a working Rust and [Substrate development environment](https://docs.substrate.io/install/). Then you can build Tuxedo like any other Rust project

```sh
# Clone to repository
git clone https://github.com/Off-Narrative-Labs/Tuxedo
cd tuxedo

# Build the node
cargo build --release -p node-template

# Build the wallet
cargo build --release -p tuxedo-template-wallet
```

Once you have the node and wallet built, you can run a development node.

```sh
# Check out the CLI if you want to
# It supports all standard Substrate CLI options
./target/release/node-template --help

# Start a development node
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

Then, in a separate terminal, experiment with the PoC wallet.

```sh
# Check out the minimal PoC CLI
./target/release/tuxedo-template-wallet --help

# Check your balance
./target/release/tuxedo-template-wallet show-balance

Balance Summary
0xd2bf‚Ä¶df67: 100
--------------------
total      : 100

# Split the 100 genesis tokens into two of values 20 and 25, burning the remaining 55
./target/release/tuxedo-template-wallet spend-coins \
  --output-amount 20 \
  --output-amount 25

  Created "337395dec41937478bb55c4e8c75911cbec061511ddbc38163b94e4386f1228c00000000" worth 20. owned by 0xd2bf‚Ä¶df67
  Created "337395dec41937478bb55c4e8c75911cbec061511ddbc38163b94e4386f1228c01000000" worth 25. owned by 0xd2bf‚Ä¶df67


# Check your balance again to confirm the burn worked
./target/release/tuxedo-template-wallet show-balance

Balance Summary
0xd2bf‚Ä¶df67: 45
--------------------
total      : 45
```

There is a more detailed walkthrough of the wallet in the [Wallet README](wallet/README.md).

## Docker

Developers and curious individuals who want to quickly try out Tuxedo and its template runtime can save the setup and compile time by using docker. CI publishes Docker images for both the example node and the PoC wallet at https://github.com/orgs/Off-Narrative-Labs/packages.

Docker is a complex software and there are many ways to pull and run images and map host ports to container ports. For those not already familiar with Docker, you may benefit from referencing the [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) or [building and running locally](#building-and-running-locally) instead.

The following commands are meant as a quickstart that will work on most platforms for users who already have Docker setup.

```sh
# Run a development node with Docker
docker run --network host ghcr.io/off-narrative-labs/tuxedo --dev

# In a separate terminal, explore the PoC wallet's CLI
docker run --network host ghcr.io/off-narrative-labs/tuxedo-wallet --help

# Use the PoC wallet to confirm that a 100 token genesis utxo is present
docker run --network host ghcr.io/off-narrative-labs/tuxedo-wallet show-balance

Balance Summary
0xd2bf‚Ä¶df67: 100
--------------------
total      : 100
```

More example commands are listed above in the section on [running locally](#building-and-running-locally). They all work with docker as well.

## Testing and Code Quality

Tuxedo strives for excellent code quality which is enforced through unit tests, and [clippy linting](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/clippy/). Both of these are enforced in the CI, which you are free to inspect. You may also run them locally.

```sh
# Run unit tests on all aspects of the project
cargo test

# Run clippy (which requires nightly)
cargo +nightly clippy
```
